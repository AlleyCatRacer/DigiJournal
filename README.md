# DigiJournal
## The reasoning

I used to struggle with planning, both short term and long term. In order to combat that, I tried various different ways to help me keep track of and prioritize my time. In the end, I settled for an unlined bullet journal because it is highly customizable, portable and allowed me to tap a little into my creative side. This has worked well so far, however I keep running into the same problems with this solution:

1. Paper is fragile, prone to water damage and crinkling
2. Environmental concerns
3. Pens run out of ink and are expensive
4. A book and pencil case is too big to fit in a pocket
    - The more freedom of customization the more physical storage space is needed
    - Leads to taking notes in multiple places, such as the laptop, phone or post-its
5. Ink is final
    - Mistakes are an eyesore
    - Once you assign a category its characteristics it can be hard to change
6. Space allocation is tricky when planning the future
5. Rifling through pages to find what you need is inefficient
    - There are only so many bookmarks you can place in a single journal
8. Time consuming process of drawing customized templates for each time period or subject
9. The information is only accessible in one place, as opposed to being available digitally online

Therefore, I have decided to create this application to replace my bullet journal as my project for Android Development at VIA University College.
